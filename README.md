# 🩺 MedSRGAN: Bone Fracture Image Enhancement using GANs

A deep learning-based framework for enhancing **bone fracture X-ray images** using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This project improves low-quality radiographs by restoring fine anatomical details and enhancing diagnostic clarity.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Medical X-ray images often suffer from:
- Low contrast  
- Noise and artifacts  
- Loss of fine fracture details  

This project proposes **MedSRGAN**, a GAN-based architecture that enhances radiographic images while preserving critical anatomical structures for improved diagnosis.

### 🔹 Key Components

- **Generator (RRDB-based)**  
  Learns to reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs 

- **Discriminator**  
  Distinguishes between real and generated images  

- **Feature Extractor (VGG19)**  
  Used for perceptual loss to preserve structural details  

- **Loss Function**
  - Pixel Loss (MSE)
  - Perceptual Loss (VGG19)
  - Adversarial Loss

To improve generalization, the dataset is augmented using:
- Gaussian noise  
- Rotation  
- Flipping  
- Brightness & contrast variation
